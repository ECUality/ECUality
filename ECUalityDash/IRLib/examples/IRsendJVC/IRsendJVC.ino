/*
 * JVC sends repeat codes that are identical to the regular JVC codes
 * however they have no header. Therefore there is an additional parameter
 * that tells you whether or not to send as an original code or as a repeat.
 *
 * The only device I had to test this protocol was an old JVC VCR. It would only work if at least
 * 2 frames are sent separated by 45us of "space". All JVC is the same bit length so we use
 * the third parameter as a flag to tell it whether or not to send the header.
 * Send once with the third parameter "1" then delay about 50 microseconds and send again
 * with the third parameter "0".
