# ECUality

This project is about taking full control of a fuel-injection system, and making that process easy to understand and do. Currently, the system is built to run the engine in a 1984 VW vanagon. I aim to create a platform that bears adaptation requiring a minimum of external tools. 

ECUality differs from other ECU projects in that I avoid relying on complex tuning software, favoring simple map-tuning algorithms that run all the time.
